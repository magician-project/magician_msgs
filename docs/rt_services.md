# Real-Time Services

This page will contain the description of real-time application service messages, as per the [proposed software infrastructure](https://magician-project.github.io/magician-project/framework.html#software-infrastructure-overview).

## Task Planning

### `srv/task_planning/deterministic_orienteering`

This service aims at providing the solution of the deterministic orienteering problem, i.e., given a set of defects to rework (with an associated rework time and reward) and the time to travel between them, yields the time-constrained optimal sequence of defects.

Inputs are:
- `defects`: The list of defects to be rework (internally they contain information of reward and rework time);
- `travel_times`: If we have {math}`n` `defects`, `travel_times` is the row-major representation of the transition-time matrix {math}`(\tau_{ij}) = T \in \mathbb R^{n\times n}`, where each entry {math}`\tau_{ij}` is the time required to move from the i-th defect to the j-th one. `travel_time` is a Flattened 2D array with size of {math}`num^2`, where travel_times[i * num + j] = {math}`\tau_{ij}`
- `max_time`: The maximum time, in seconds, over which to allocate the tasks.

The output consists of:
- `roadmap`: The ordered list of defects to rework.
- `service_times`: The service time {math}`s` at the corresponding defects on the roadmap.
